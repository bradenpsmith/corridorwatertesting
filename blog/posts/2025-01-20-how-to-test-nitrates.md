# How to Test for Nitrates in Well Water

Nitrate contamination in private wells is a serious concern, especially for infants and pregnant women. Elevated nitrates can cause **blue baby syndrome** and may signal agricultural or septic system runoff.

## Why Nitrates Matter

- **Invisible and tasteless** – You won’t notice them without testing.  
- **Health risks** – Can impact oxygen levels in infants’ blood.  
- **Environmental signals** – High nitrates can mean nearby fertilizer, manure, or septic issues.

## How to Test Your Well for Nitrates

1. **Get a test kit** – Use a certified lab or a mail-in kit approved for drinking water.  
2. **Collect the sample carefully** – Follow the lab’s instructions to avoid contamination.  
3. **Send it promptly** – Nitrate levels can change over time if samples sit too long.

## Interpreting the Results

- **Below 10 mg/L** (as nitrogen) – Safe for drinking.  
- **Above 10 mg/L** – Unsafe for infants and pregnant women; consider treatment or an alternative water source.

## Reducing Nitrate Contamination

- Inspect and maintain your **septic system** regularly.  
- Avoid over-fertilizing lawns and crops near your well.  
- Create a **buffer zone** between wells and livestock or manure storage.

By testing regularly and understanding your results, you can prevent health risks and protect your water for the long term.
