# Well Water Testing Basics

Owning a private well comes with the responsibility of making sure your water is safe to drink. Unlike municipal water, which is regularly monitored and treated, private well water safety is entirely up to the homeowner.

## Why Annual Testing is Important

Well water can be contaminated by:

- **Bacteria** – Such as coliform or E. coli from nearby septic systems or runoff.
- **Nitrates** – From fertilizer, livestock, or natural soil deposits.
- **Heavy Metals** – Like lead or arsenic, which can leach from plumbing or soil.
- **Other Chemicals** – Such as pesticides or industrial contaminants.

Regular testing gives you peace of mind and ensures you catch potential issues before they become a health risk.

## What Should You Test For?

At a minimum, most health departments recommend testing annually for:

1. **Total Coliform Bacteria**  
2. **Nitrates**  
3. **pH and Basic Minerals**  

If your area has known risks, you may also consider testing for arsenic, pesticides, or radon.

## When to Test More Frequently

Even if you test annually, consider testing **immediately** if:

- There has been **flooding** near your well.  
- You notice a **change in taste, color, or odor**.  
- Someone in your home experiences **unexplained illness**.  
- There’s **new construction or chemical use** nearby.

## How to Get Started

- **Use a certified lab** – Many local health departments have recommendations.  
- **Take samples carefully** – Follow instructions to avoid contamination.  
- **Keep records** – Compare results year over year to spot trends.

Ensuring your water is safe isn’t just about compliance—it’s about protecting your family’s health for years to come.
